# Quiz-Application-Simple-

This is a simple application developed through netbeans. This was developed as part of mini project in my college.

This application has two type of users
  1. Teacher
  2. Student
  
The application allows students to take part in quiz in a particular subject. The teacher adds question in a database. When a student starts the quiz, 10 questions are shown randomly from that selected subject. The teacher has power to add, remove, modify questions and also can add, remove users.

Added some screenshots of the application UI.
